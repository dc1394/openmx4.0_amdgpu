/* Shared rank-to-device map used by every site that binds a rank to a GPU.
   Contiguous blocks of local ranks share a device (block map) instead of the
   old round-robin (local_rank % device_count): the Band solver's k-point
   worlds are contiguous rank blocks whose owner ranks sit world-size apart,
   so a round-robin map can place every k-owner on device 0 and serialize
   their concurrent eigensolves.  The block map spreads the owners across
   the allowed devices while keeping the same number of ranks per device,
   and it must be the ONLY map in the binary: a rank's HIP and OpenMP device
   must stay identical from initialization to the last SCF step.  Set
   OPENMX_GPU_RANK_MAP=mod to restore the old map. */
